# rubypassword
A simple password program created in ruby using the gems conceal and goto.

I have four extra small files attached that show the simple implmenation of the gems.

(goto.rb, goto2.rb) use the 'goto' gem and show how it works.

(pepper.rb, salty.rb) show how the 'conceal' gem functions.

DO NOT DELETE OR EXCLUDE THE ACCOUNT TEXT FILE.  This is a file that will hold the name of the accounts for which the program has.
To delete a user entirely you can edit the text file and remove the name of the person and delete the file with the name.

*may add delete functionality later*
