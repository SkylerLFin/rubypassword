# rubypassword
A simple password program created in ruby using the gems conceal and goto.

I have four extra small files attached that show the simple implmenation of the gems.

(goto.rb, goto2.rb) use the 'goto' gem and show how it works.

(pepper.rb, salty.rb) show how the 'conceal' gem functions.
